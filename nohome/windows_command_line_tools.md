# Windows Command Line Tools

Windows command line tools are a comparably simple vector for cybersecurity attacks in an era of advanced cryptography, sophisticated cracking tools, DNS tunneling, and dozens more, and yet they are no less dangerous. It is not hard to see why: Windows Powershell, a ubiquitous program and command terminal that comes factory default with any Windows OS today, is often utilized for running high-level administrative tasks in an automated fashion through the use of scripts. Were an attacker to gain access to that terminal, then, they would have most of the resources on the network at their disposal.

There’s numerous other forms of command line tools and attacks, but they generally share one major function as far as attackers are concerned: they allow attackers to proxy execute code through a program that security systems will have whitelisted. Regsvr32.exe is one other such popular tool, which can execute code like Powershell but can also link a computer to a file on the internet via a URL embedded in a DLL used by the program. This is referred to as a “Squiblydoo” attack and has been used against government computers in the past, having been a supremely reliable method before advancements in cybersecurity monitoring and patches were made.
