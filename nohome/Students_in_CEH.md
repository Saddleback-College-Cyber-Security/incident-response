Inside the directory `readme` you will find the following goodies to get you started on your journey.

- A list of topics being investigated (feel free to add to this!)
- A cheatsheet for markdown
- A list of all CEH students and their respective section assignments (this list is mostly for grading; feel free to add to any section!)

## For Students in CEH

If you are a student in Professor Barnett's & Professor Karla's Certified Ethical Hacker course, you are required to participate in the creation of this document. 

As threatening as that sounds, don not fret - this will be **fun**!

### Grading

Grading is at the discretion of Professo Karla, and as such any final grading questions should be directred to her via discord or email. Grades will be based on participation in this project (again, at the discretion of Professor Karla).

Participation is tracked through your contributions to the git repo you are reading this from. As long as you are remembering to push your changes, your grade is secure.
