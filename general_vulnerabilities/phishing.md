# Phishing


## Abstract:

Phishing is a type of Social Engineering, in which the person attacking uses software to obtain the confidential or sensitive information from a legitimate user by mirroring trusted organization through an automated fashion. Phishing is an imminent threat  to all internet users, because it hard to trace or defend a user against because it does not represent itself with malicious intent. The word phishing first came around in 1995 , when scammers from the internet used emails to find passwords and financial information  from internet users. The “ph”is a normal way to represent “F” that drives from the original form of hacking. In the early stages of phishing the code was copied from the AOL website and designed web pages to make it look like they were part of AOL, and they sent the fake emails or even instant messages with a link to this fake web page, by asking potential victims their username and passwords.  Nowadays everything is put online and the critical information is at risk.  Phishing is one of the simplest ways together personal information from people and use it against them. 

## Introduction

Phishing has become a more difficult and elevating threat to the security of all users on the Internet. Phishers are hard to find because they’re to conceal their location on their servers and are able to work while remaining anonymous. A user with great security can still become a victim of a phishing attack.  A vast majority of the information that is found was typed onto a form, not based on a computer that was infected by malware. There are several different ways to help defend against phishing attacks. You can find an attack before it reaches a user. When a user reaches a phishing website, or a user can be trained to be aware of the attack. Over the years Phishing has become so advance and secret over the years that there are $500m in losses every year in business in the US. 
There are several different types of clone phishing the these are some of them.

## 1.1.	Clone Phishing 

The first type is called clone Phishing, in which the attacker generates a email that is cloned. He does this by gathering information like data an addresses from the recipient and legitimate email was delivered before, he then sends the same email with malicious links attached. He also spoofs the address so that the email appears to be from an original sender. The attacker can use a strategy to trap by showing how the email can be a resend from the original or an updated version. 

## 1.2.	Spear Phishing 

The second type of phishing is called spear phishing, in spear phishing a particular group or person is targeted perhaps a CEO or member of upper management or security clearance. But instead of sending out thousands of emails at various times, spear phishing is designed to choose people with something in common with people from the same business. There is another form spear phishing called “Whaling” where A CEO’s is targeted.  IN 2008 many CEOs in the US were given fake subpoenas that also came with an attachment that would install malware each time it was read.

## 1.3 Phone Phishing

The next type of phishing is called phone phishing refers to messages that claim to be from a bank that will request users to dial a phone numbers based on problems with their bank account. Original phone gear comes with dedicated lines, so Voice or IP, being simple to manipulate, it becomes an easy choice for a phisher.  When the number is dialed the phisher can use a VOIP service to ask the victim to enter his or her account numbers as well as their PIN.  A phisher can also use caller ID spoofing which is not a criminal offense.

## 1.4 Email Spoofing

In email spoofing, a user is sent a fake email made to believe it was from a legitimate organization, so that recipients are more then likely to think the message and take actions based on their instructions. Spoofed emails usually appear to be from a website or a financial business that the receiver may have business with and take actions that were instructed by email contents. They will reply the email with the credit card number, they will click the link labeled “view my statement” and enter the password when the website that is forged for it opens with an PDF form that is attached to enter all your confidential information. 

## 1.5 Web Spoofing  

The attacker can create a fake website to look like a real one, so that victims may think the website is real and they let their guard down so the victim will enter their passwords and personal information that obtained by the phisher.  The way web spoofing works is that first a fake website is created by mirror the look of legitimate website by copying codes from the front end. A bit of web programming is necessary to redirect user’s input into a document or database. Then display a website as being under maintenance. A Phisher can use a proxy software like squid or fiddler could be used to design a mirror or clone. A users can successfully sign in and use all the services provided by the original website. When each input is gathered by the server and all pages can be changed by the server. In order to attract traffic on a forged website, when a website that is forged is active the phisher can transfer spoofed emails with a link to the forged website.  A Phisher can register a domain that is common typo of a familiar website. For example, register paypel.com and create a forged paypal account. They can slo register the same domain   name and change the TLD. Sometimes user will type in their specific-country TLD and assume they will get a localized version of the website. 

## 1.6 Evil Twin

In an Evil Twin phishing, evil sets its crosshairs on Wi-Fi. The attacker creates a wireless access point to lure unsuspecting victims in so that the attacker can obtain criitcal information about a person  or business without the permission from the end-users.The attack using Evil twin will use the set service identifier that is the same as the  network. When a user connects to the network the attacker can listen in on their network traffic and take usernames,passwords, and look at all attachments on the users account while connected to the hotspot that compromised.

## 1.7 HTTPS Phishing 

How is it works, an attacker uses this attack by sending an email from what looks like a legitmate website link from the email body. There’s often no other except for link itself which maybe clickable or a non-active link that makes the user to copy and paste the URL into the URL address bar.
