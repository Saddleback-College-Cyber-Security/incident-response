## What is a Virus

A computer virus is known to be a malicious, self-replicating program. It is a piece of code that enters a device without permission or knowledge. The purpose of a virus is to spread, destroy and take over control of any device connected to the internet.

A virus has four phases: 
- Dormant: When a virus is incognito, lying in the background, waiting.
- Propagation: When the virus self-replicates, attaching itself to programs, files and parts of the hard disk. Clones normally replicate with an altered 
- Triggering: The action which activates the virus. The action may be programmed or launched by a physical user. The trigger is generally obscure on purpose to dissuade other to determine its true origin. 
- Execution: The stage where the virus will release its payload. The payload is the malicious code that harms the device in question.

## Virus Objectives and Purposes

A virus has two general objectives, to execute a task and to self-reproduce. 
A virus’s purpose is generally to harm, annoy, take over, destroy and kill (this is when your device is rendered unusable) a person or organizations device(s).

## How Many Viruses are There

There are about 10,000 known computer viruses and over 200 new viruses surface each month.

Viruses spread via:
- The Internet
- Emails
- Electronic bulletin boards
- Virtual advertisements
- Downloads, Messaging Services
- Old/unmaintained software
- Your network

## Red Flags

- Excessive disk accesses
- Programs running at a slow speed to slow performance
- Program and, or system freezing or crashing
- Turned on access lights for non-references devices
- A decrease in memory or system resources
- Unusual computer files and programs missing or corrupted
- Unexplained reduction of disk space
- Hidden and deleted files resurface
- Size change of an executable file
- Continuous pop-ups
- Hard drive lag
- Unprecedented system behavior
- Messaging services spamming all those in your contact list

## Detecting Viruses

- A virus-scanning program
- Anti-virus software 
	- good antivirus should provide:
		- On-demand or on-access scanning
		- Routine scheduled full system scans
- Monitor network traffic (IDS/IPS for corporate networks)
- Check for any software installed that shouldn’t be
- Check for any unexpected folders on the root or in program directories

## Preventative Measures

- Be a skeptic, question ads and correspondence that seems fabricated or too good to be true
- Stay away from insecure downloads, especially those pertaining to pirated media
- Do not add an app until you determine it is safe
- Do not click on ads or pop-ups
- Install your computer updates
- Enhance your protection by adding additional layers of security
- Install updates regularly for your network devices, ie your modem or router
- Don’t use unsecure WiFi, change your WiFi password periodically
