# Malware

[home](../README.md)
- [Example](#Example)

Malware is any malicious software/program that can damage or disable a computer system and gives partial
or full control to the creator of the malware for either theft or fraud purposes.

Malware includes but is not limited to ransomware, viruses, trojans, rootkits, spyware and many more.

These malware attacks can delete files, slow down computers, commit fraud and steal any personal information on the system
(CEH Book).

Some of the most common malware attacks are going to be: Viruses, Worms, Crypto-Malware/Ransomware, Trojans and Rootkits.

Viruses: Are easily sent to emails with malicious links that can allow to virus to propagate.

Worms: They do not need any user interactions; the worm can propagate on their own and start consuming network bandwidth.

Crypto-Malware/Ransomware: These are malicious attacks on the system that are meant to hold valuable information for ransom.
They use encryption on the sensitive information that was attacked which the attacker then askes for a ransom on the 
information and once the ransom is received the attacker sends the decryption key to the victim.

Trojans: Usually disguised as legitimate software or applications which once downloaded and ran through the user permissions
it is given full access to the network or system allowing for the implementation of backdoors for future access.

Rootkits: Custom type of backdoor that is specific to the firmware or hardware that is being run on the victim OS.
They are unique to each system which makes it difficult to detect and remove.
They can operate in privilege modes and they can run in the hardware as well (Infosec Institute).

Countermeasures:

For most malware attacks the countermeasures are the same.

1. Anti-Virus Software installed and kept up to date
2. Email servers should have their own dedicated anti-virus set up
3. MAKE SURE USERS ARE TRAINED IN IDENTIFYING SUSPICIOUS EMAILS AND WEB ACTIVITY
4. Block attachments at network borders
5. Remove removable drives to prevent unauthorized software from entering system
6. For Ransomware:
	a. Have backups in place
	b. Anti-virus and anti-spam installed
	c. Disable macros scripts
	d. Up to date systems (patches)
	e. Internet restrictions: use of proxy servers and ad-blocking software
	f. Use of least privilege and network segmentation
	g. Provide social engineering and phishing training
7. For Rootkits:
	a. Install Rootkit scans
	b. With rootkits, once they are in the system it is almost impossible to remove them or detect them
	but with all the other countermeasures in place you have a better chance to prevent them
