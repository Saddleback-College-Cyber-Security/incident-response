# FTP  

## Incident Overview  

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.   
FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.  

Research and provide information on the following concepts:  

- Process for setting up an FTP and SFTP Server     
    - Note differences for setup of FTP and SFTP
    - Note setup differences by platform (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)    
- Process for sending a file to an FTP/SFTP Server     
    - Note any differences between the two types of servers
    - Note any software used to FTP files
    - Note any command line tools or commands used to FTP files 
- Common vulnerabilities and how to protect against these attacks
- Strategies for maintaining an FTP server (e.g. how to notice malicious activity, etc.)
