# Password Management  

## Incident Overview  

We all know what a password is, however management of passwords is a big part of information technology.   

This incident covers several different aspects of passwords, updated frequently to adhere to ever-changing guidelines for password length and complexity.

Research and provide information on the following concepts:  

- Current standard for minimum password length and complexity (as of April 2020)   
    - NIST recommends no password complexity requirements
    - NIST also recommends no password lifetime requirements - only forcing a password change when a password is suspected to be compromised.
    - NIST does require a list of common passwords to disallow.
    - NIST also recommends increasing the length of passwords
- Commands for performing the following:     
    - Changing password for accounts
        - Note differences in OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
        - Note differences in privilage requirement (e.g. whether ```sudo``` is needed on Linux)
    - Changing password lifetime
        - Note differences in OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
        - Note differences in privilage requirement (e.g. whether ```sudo``` is needed on Linux)
