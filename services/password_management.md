# Password Management  

## Incident Overview  

We all know what a password is, however management of passwords is a big part of information technology.   

This incident covers several different aspects of passwords, updated frequently to adhere to ever-changing guidelines for password length and complexity.

Research and provide information on the following concepts:  

- Current standard for minimum password length and complexity (as of April 2020)   
    - NIST recommends no password complexity requirements
    - NIST also recommends no password lifetime requirements - only forcing a password change when a password is suspected to be compromised.
    - NIST does require a list of common passwords to disallow.
    - NIST also recommends increasing the length of passwords
- How to perform:     
    - Change a password:
        - Linux
          - Note differences in OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
          - Note differences in privilege requirement (e.g. whether ```sudo``` is needed on Linux)
        - Windows
          - local accounts
            - version 1803 and onward
              - click the reset button.
              - answer the security questions
            - prior to version 1803
              - reset the device
              - this WILL wipe your data however. make sure to backup important data!
          - Microsoft accounts

    - Change a password for Linux

    - Change password lifetime:
        - Linux:
          - Note differences in OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
