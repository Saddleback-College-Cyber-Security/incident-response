## Central Authentication Service

### Incident Overview  

The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on protocol for the web.  
Its purpose is to permit a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as userid and password) only once.   
It also allows web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password.   
The name CAS also refers to a software package that implements this protocol.      

Research and provide information on the following concepts:  

- Overview of CAS 
    - Common Business Usecases
    - Common Tasks performed (e.g. setup, configuration, etc.)
- How to find an instance of CAS running on a system
    - Note differences in OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Note differences in privilage requirement (e.g. whether ```sudo``` is needed on Linux)
- Common vulnerabilities and how to protect against them
- Strategies for maintenance (e.g. how to notice malicious activity, protect against attackers etc.)
