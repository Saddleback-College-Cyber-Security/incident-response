Research and provide information on the following concepts:  

- Overview of NFS
    - Common Business Usecases
    - Common Tasks performed (e.g. setup, configuration, etc.
- How to setup an NFS server
    - Note differences in OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Note differences in privilage requirement (e.g. whether ```sudo``` is needed on Linux)    
- How to access and use an NFS server
    - Note differences in OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Note differences in privilage requirement (e.g. whether ```sudo``` is needed on Linux)
- How to find an instance running on a system
    - Note differences in OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Note differences in privilage requirement (e.g. whether ```sudo``` is needed on Linux)
- Common vulnerabilities and how to protect against them
- Strategies for maintenance (e.g. how to notice malicious activity, protect against attackers etc.)
