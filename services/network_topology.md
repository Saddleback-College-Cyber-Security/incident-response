Network topology is the arrangement of the elements of a communication network. Network topology can be used to define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks.   

Research and provide information on the following concepts:  

- Free solutions for building network topology diagrams (*see example below*)
- Best practices for creating network topologyh diagrams and key things to look out for (e.g. a tutorial on how to make one)

Bryan: Network topology

What network topology is:

- It's a digital way of displaying how different devices are connected to the networks. This helps you understand how the network works and its performance.

How does it work:

- To create the graphic representations you need to know all the components and devices in your network, this includes: serves, devices connected, PC, Phones, switches, routers, hubs, IoT devices, and more.

- Nmap with Zenmap is the best Network scanning tool that helps you have an idea on how your network is working. This scanning tool can give you the information that you need to do network topology.

Network Mapping tools:

-  PRTG Network Monitor
