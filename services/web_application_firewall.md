- [Example](#Example)

## Incident Overview  

A web application firewall (WAF) filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web application.   
A WAF is differentiated from a regular firewall in that a WAF is able to filter the content of specific web applications while regular firewalls serve as a safety gate between servers.    

Research and provide information on the following concepts:  

- Overview of WAF 
    - Common Business Usecases
    - Common Tasks performed (e.g. setup, configuration, etc.)
- How to find an instance of a WAF running on a system
    - Note differences in OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Note differences in privilage requirement (e.g. whether ```sudo``` is needed on Linux)
- Common vulnerabilities and how to protect against them
- Strategies for maintenance (e.g. how to notice malicious activity, protect against attackers etc.)
